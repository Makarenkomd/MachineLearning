It really is something you must read and take notes on so in this case, for the purpose that you're looking for, this product would not suit. However, I can suggest something for you that you may also buy on Amazon. Even though Human Japanese is an AWESOME learning tool, if you're wanting to play something in your sleep to help you tune in to the way a native speaker talks, buy yourself a book called 'Read Real Japanese.' There is an audio CD that comes with this book wherein the stories are read. You can get a real good sense of speech speed as well as start getting used to picking out words you know. It's a great sleep tool because it's interesting enough without being droning lessons and you'll start to feel yourself compelled to pick apart the speech and translations. So both products are good but Read Real Japanese is the one I'd recommend for the purposes you're aiming for and keep Human Japanese for the thing you tinker with on weekends between classes or get it on your kindle so you can read through it on the go.","Mar 13, 2013","N","0615179088","I'm taking a corse in japanese but what to suplement my classes with something that i can play while i sleep as a suplement.

Genki is a very popular textbook series that many people seem to enjoy. You could buy just the Genki workbooks to save money, as well as the answer book if you want the answers. You may need to skip around depending on what grammar point you are learning from The Manga Way/Human Japanese.

It has about 10-15 exercises per chapter, and the answers are included in the back. It's also cheap, ~$20, though it looks like Amazon doesn't have any in stock at the moment. You can also try practicing what you've learned on Lang8.com and get native speakers to correct your diary entries.

I know this because a friend (years ago) purchased the Rosetta Stone Arabic, and those squiggles are meaningless to me, but after a period I could begin to grasp why a certain squiggle is different than another. It\\'s not like Chinese, where there are hundreds of characters to learn; there are only 22 letters, only a few of which have a different form when found at the end of a word; also one letter takes a different sound based on whether there is a dot over it on one side (shin vs. sin). There are sections where spelling entire sentences is required, and those are the ones that I have the most trouble with. Happily, the program scores my answers, and allows me to retake the lesson till I get a score that is satisfactory to allow me to move on (typically high 80\\'s or the 90\\'s). I cheated and took notes on the correct answers (provided when the section is completed) and took the section again, inputting the correct answers, but wish I had not done that for the first time or two once I found out I would actually learn the words better for having to learn how to spell them. (For example, I spelled it so many times, I\\'ll never forget the Hebrew word for \"toy\" in my life!) Once I learned how valuable the spelling is, I started the program under a different name (several students are allowed, and my wife isn\\'t interested in Hebrew, so they are all me).

That said, there are work arounds available. There's a program called ScummVM. If you get the game, you can pull certain files off the CD, and this program allows you to run the game, even on a 64-bit system.

With Paint Shop Pro, you create both raster and vector images. You can also create an image with both raster and vector layers. It\\'s important to understand the differences between the two data types. Raster Images Raster images are composed of individual elements, called pixels, arranged in a grid. Each pixel has a specific location and color. If you magnify raster data, you can see the individual pixels as squares of colors. An object in a raster image is defined by its pixels. For example, the front door in an image of a house is made up of a mosaic of pixels at certain locations in the image. In bitmap images you edit pixels rather than objects or shapes. Raster images can display subtle changes in tones and colors, so they are most often used for images like photographs and digital artwork. Raster images contain a fixed number of pixels, so when you magnify the image you are magnifying the display size of the pixels. As a result, raster images can display jagged rather than smooth edges if magnified on screen or printed at a large magnification. Vector Graphics Vector graphics or images use geometric characteristics-lines, curves, and their locations-to define objects. For example, a door in a graphic of a house is made up of a rectangle with a certain width and height at a specific location and filled with a certain color. In vector images you edit objects or shapes rather than pixels. Vector graphics do not lose clarity or detail when scaled to any size or printed at any resolution. They work well for technical illustrations or corporate logos. Choosing Raster or Vector In Paint Shop Pro, you create and edit raster and vector data on separate layers. With some tools you create raster data (like brush strokes with the Paint tool) and with other tools (like the Text and Preset Shapes tools) you can choose whether you want to create raster or vector data. In general, use vector objects when you\\'ll need to edit the object as an element separate from other parts of the image. For example, if you add a star to an image, you may want to change its size, color or location. This is easier if the star is a vector object. You can create raster data on separate layers so you can easily edit or move them. To apply tools or commands to vector objects that work only on raster data (such as the painting tools or the effects commands), you can create a raster selection of a vector object. Then, paste the selection to a new raster layer.

Even though Human Japanese is an AWESOME learning tool, if you're wanting to play something in your sleep to help you tune in to the way a native speaker talks, buy yourself a book called 'Read Real Japanese.' There is an audio CD that comes with this book wherein the stories are read. You can get a real good sense of speech speed as well as start getting used to picking out words you know. It's a great sleep tool because it's interesting enough without being droning lessons and you'll start to feel yourself compelled to pick apart the speech and translations.

(Have you found a workbook that you like? If so, please post back.) You could grab an additional textbook that includes exercises, or just the corresponding workbook. Genki is a very popular textbook series that many people seem to enjoy. You could buy just the Genki workbooks to save money, as well as the answer book if you want the answers. You may need to skip around depending on what grammar point you are learning from The Manga Way/Human Japanese. I'm using Japanese for Everyone and I like it, but it is pretty fast-paced, explanations are relatively brief, so it isn't for everyone. It has about 10-15 exercises per chapter, and the answers are included in the back. It's also cheap, ~$20, though it looks like Amazon doesn't have any in stock at the moment.

If you don\\'t know the aleph-bet, simply pay attention to the shapes of the letters and listen to the speakers give the phrases, and before long, you will be able to figure out the reading, too. I know this because a friend (years ago) purchased the Rosetta Stone Arabic, and those squiggles are meaningless to me, but after a period I could begin to grasp why a certain squiggle is different than another. It\\'s not like Chinese, where there are hundreds of characters to learn; there are only 22 letters, only a few of which have a different form when found at the end of a word; also one letter takes a different sound based on whether there is a dot over it on one side (shin vs. sin). There are sections where spelling entire sentences is required, and those are the ones that I have the most trouble with. Happily, the program scores my answers, and allows me to retake the lesson till I get a score that is satisfactory to allow me to move on (typically high 80\\'s or the 90\\'s). I cheated and took notes on the correct answers (provided when the section is completed) and took the section again, inputting the correct answers, but wish I had not done that for the first time or two once I found out I would actually learn the words better for having to learn how to spell them. (For example, I spelled it so many times, I\\'ll never forget the Hebrew word for \"toy\" in my life!) Once I learned how valuable the spelling is, I started the program under a different name (several students are allowed, and my wife isn\\'t interested in Hebrew, so they are all me).

The Pajama Sam game, along with the other Humongous Entertainment games of its time, runs in 16-bit. Windows operating systems are able to emulate back one generation, so 32-bit can emulate 16-bit, but 64-bit can only emulate as far back as 32-bit. So, if you're running 32-bit Windows 7, you'll be able to run the game just fine off the disc. If you're running 64-bit Windows 7 (or any Windows OS), the game will not natively run off the disc. That said, there are work arounds available. There's a program called ScummVM. If you get the game, you can pull certain files off the CD, and this program allows you to run the game, even on a 64-bit system. For more info on that program, visit http://scummvm.org/ Hope this helps.

With Paint Shop Pro, you create both raster and vector images. You can also create an image with both raster and vector layers. It\\'s important to understand the differences between the two data types. Raster Images Raster images are composed of individual elements, called pixels, arranged in a grid. Each pixel has a specific location and color. If you magnify raster data, you can see the individual pixels as squares of colors. An object in a raster image is defined by its pixels. For example, the front door in an image of a house is made up of a mosaic of pixels at certain locations in the image. In bitmap images you edit pixels rather than objects or shapes. Raster images can display subtle changes in tones and colors, so they are most often used for images like photographs and digital artwork. Raster images contain a fixed number of pixels, so when you magnify the image you are magnifying the display size of the pixels. As a result, raster images can display jagged rather than smooth edges if magnified on screen or printed at a large magnification. Vector Graphics Vector graphics or images use geometric characteristics-lines, curves, and their locations-to define objects. For example, a door in a graphic of a house is made up of a rectangle with a certain width and height at a specific location and filled with a certain color. In vector images you edit objects or shapes rather than pixels. Vector graphics do not lose clarity or detail when scaled to any size or printed at any resolution. They work well for technical illustrations or corporate logos. Choosing Raster or Vector In Paint Shop Pro, you create and edit raster and vector data on separate layers. With some tools you create raster data (like brush strokes with the Paint tool) and with other tools (like the Text and Preset Shapes tools) you can choose whether you want to create raster or vector data. In general, use vector objects when you\\'ll need to edit the object as an element separate from other parts of the image. For example, if you add a star to an image, you may want to change its size, color or location. This is easier if the star is a vector object. You can create raster data on separate layers so you can easily edit or move them. To apply tools or commands to vector objects that work only on raster data (such as the painting tools or the effects commands), you can create a raster selection of a vector object. Then, paste the selection to a new raster layer.

You can import your own text into the program for practicing on things you'd need to read anyway, and it comes with 625 e-books, on all different topics, that you can practice. 7 Speed Reading offers only limited tests and does not allow you to customize.

My sister and I started out using and choosing from thier formats, but our book got so large, we are now using it in combination with Publisher so we can add additional features separate from the recipes. I'm not able to comment on the other product you mention. We started our project a little over 10 years ago. MC was the best one we found at the time. For health reasons and others, it has taken us a good while to complete our project, but we've found MC 4.0 and 5.0, even as old as they are, still great resources. Easy to use, quite a few recipe layout options, 5.0 has more complete nutrition information, places to write notes/family anecdotes at the start or finish of your recipe, flexibility with the ingredient list, in case you are using something not included there or are using another recipe as an ingredient. I imagine 9.0 is even better, more updated, though like I say, I can't speak to it directly. Hopefully someone else can help you with that. Good luck with your project.

It really is something you must read and take notes on so in this case, for the purpose that you're looking for, this product would not suit. However, I can suggest something for you that you may also buy on Amazon. Even though Human Japanese is an AWESOME learning tool, if you're wanting to play something in your sleep to help you tune in to the way a native speaker talks, buy yourself a book called 'Read Real Japanese.' There is an audio CD that comes with this book wherein the stories are read. You can get a real good sense of speech speed as well as start getting used to picking out words you know. It's a great sleep tool because it's interesting enough without being droning lessons and you'll start to feel yourself compelled to pick apart the speech and translations.

Windows operating systems are able to emulate back one generation, so 32-bit can emulate 16-bit, but 64-bit can only emulate as far back as 32-bit. So, if you're running 32-bit Windows 7, you'll be able to run the game just fine off the disc. If you're running 64-bit Windows 7 (or any Windows OS), the game will not natively run off the disc. That said, there are work arounds available. There's a program called ScummVM. If you get the game, you can pull certain files off the CD, and this program allows you to run the game, even on a 64-bit system.

Easy to use, quite a few recipe layout options, 5.0 has more complete nutrition information, places to write notes/family anecdotes at the start or finish of your recipe, flexibility with the ingredient list, in case you are using something not included there or are using another recipe as an ingredient.

It really is something you must read and take notes on so in this case, for the purpose that you're looking for, this product would not suit. However, I can suggest something for you that you may also buy on Amazon. Even though Human Japanese is an AWESOME learning tool, if you're wanting to play something in your sleep to help you tune in to the way a native speaker talks, buy yourself a book called 'Read Real Japanese.' There is an audio CD that comes with this book wherein the stories are read. You can get a real good sense of speech speed as well as start getting used to picking out words you know.

Genki is a very popular textbook series that many people seem to enjoy. You could buy just the Genki workbooks to save money, as well as the answer book if you want the answers. You may need to skip around depending on what grammar point you are learning from The Manga Way/Human Japanese. I'm using Japanese for Everyone and I like it, but it is pretty fast-paced, explanations are relatively brief, so it isn't for everyone. It has about 10-15 exercises per chapter, and the answers are included in the back. It's also cheap, ~$20, though it looks like Amazon doesn't have any in stock at the moment. You can also try practicing what you've learned on Lang8.com and get native speakers to correct your diary entries.

So only 2 people could use it at a time, I did try it on my daughters computer, but you cannot access the online programs as she is the registered user on that computer- I am told also that using the online program cost more after 3 months- so using it was not that good. Instead, I found Duolingo it is free and apparently more successful than Rosetta Stone is- there is some plateau- ing but no more than RS.

I found I was really struggling with Rosetta Stone until I took a few days to learn both Hiragana and Katakana phonetic writing systems (46 characters each, but the sounds are the same). Once I did that, the whole thing made complete sense because I could match up what I was hearing with what I was seeing. Japanese as a whole is not an overly complex language; it doesn't have a lot of exceptions to the rule, but there are some significant differences with a language such as English. Before you spend this kind of money on something a child may or may not stick with, I would strongly suggest using the web to see how they take to learning Hiragana and Katakana.

The Pajama Sam game, along with the other Humongous Entertainment games of its time, runs in 16-bit. Windows operating systems are able to emulate back one generation, so 32-bit can emulate 16-bit, but 64-bit can only emulate as far back as 32-bit. So, if you're running 32-bit Windows 7, you'll be able to run the game just fine off the disc. If you're running 64-bit Windows 7 (or any Windows OS), the game will not natively run off the disc. That said, there are work arounds available. There's a program called ScummVM. If you get the game, you can pull certain files off the CD, and this program allows you to run the game, even on a 64-bit system. For more info on that program, visit http://scummvm.org/ Hope this helps.

It contains 830 reading comprehension tests, themed and grade-leveled, so you'll always know where you stand, as well as numerous drills and fun yet educational games. You can work through an automated Course Mode, or you can choose to customize all aspects of your reading experience through the Reading Mode, including importing your own text into the program to use for practice. And with 625 added e-books, you'll never run out of things on which to practice. Most users see double to triple their baseline reading rate with 15-20 minutes of daily practice, but it does vary from person to person. Any improvement in reading speed and comprehension, though, is a good thing.

Easy to use, quite a few recipe layout options, 5.0 has more complete nutrition information, places to write notes/family anecdotes at the start or finish of your recipe, flexibility with the ingredient list, in case you are using something not included there or are using another recipe as an ingredient. I imagine 9.0 is even better, more updated, though like I say, I can't speak to it directly. Hopefully someone else can help you with that. Good luck with your project.

I love all the features and have logged 419 of our families recipes including pictures with hopes of a cookbook someday. However, that said, it has not been Mac friendly, the updates have included the PC only. So, that leaves the Mac users still using the old version 4.0.6. Meaning, that as new cooking ingredients come to market, you have to add them in yourself. It has huge print problems. I found a workaround, saving the recipes as a PDF and then printing. Another big draw back is having to use it in 'Classic. But, I am exictied today I got an email bulletin about Mariner Software's Mac Gourmet Deluxe. I am in the process of reviewing it with high hopes.
